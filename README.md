# Flutter Testing V2

A new Flutter application with the purpose of being used to learn the framework and Dart language.

## Getting Started

This project is an experiment with various Flutter Tutorials.

It will be a collection of tutorials, experiments, and code snippets pulled from the [Tutorial and Info Links](#tutorial-and-info-links) section 

## Tutorial and Info Links

01) [Build iOS & Android Apps w/ Google's Flutter & Dart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZCz6Ylqk3A)

	This tutorial went through the basics of the Flutter platform. I used parts of it in the initial builds, but have replaced a good amount of it since then.
	
02) [Flutter Layouts](https://github.com/bizz84/layout-demo-flutter). Linked from: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zJ6CnOVndE&t=7s)

	This is a collection of layouts and sample code pieces that gives a ton of info on how to use the Flutter UI. 
	I will mostly copy this code over and go through it piece by piece to try and break things until I understand how they work.
	This is a great tutorial for learning how the various Flutter widgets work and can be created / augmented.
