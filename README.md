# Flutter Testing V2

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is an experiment with various Flutter Tutorials.

## Tutorial and Info Links:

01) [Build iOS & Android Apps w/ Google's Flutter & Dart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZCz6Ylqk3A)
	This tutorial went through the basics of the Flutter platform. I used parts of it in the initial builds, but have replaced a good amount of it since then.
	
02) [Flutter Layouts](https://github.com/bizz84/layout-demo-flutter). Linked from: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zJ6CnOVndE&t=7s)
	This is a collection of layouts and sample code pieces that gives a ton of info on how to use the Flutter UI. 
	I will mostly copy this code over and go through it piece by piece to try and break things until I understand how they work.
